### ðŸ§¾ Reconciliation App â€” Description and Purpose
## âœ… Problem It Solves
In many schools or educational programs, tracking payments and purchases made by enrollees can be chaotic and error-prone. Data is often scattered across paper receipts, Excel files, or informal records.

This app solves the problem by providing:

A secure, centralized, and structured way to track both payments and purchases.

The ability to filter, review, and export transaction history.

A clean interface that prevents accidental submissions via confirmation dialogs.

Itâ€™s useful for:
Bursars
Account officers

Admin staff in schools or training institutes
...who need to reconcile financial records easily.

4. Automatic ID Lookup
When recording payments or purchases, IDs for enrollees, schools, and items are automatically fetched from the database to maintain relational integrity.
