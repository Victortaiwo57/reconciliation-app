### ðŸ§¾ Reconciliation App â€” Description and Purpose
## âœ… Problem It Solves
In many schools or educational programs, tracking payments and purchases made by enrollees can be chaotic and error-prone. Data is often scattered across paper receipts, Excel files, or informal records.

This app solves the problem by providing:

A secure, centralized, and structured way to track both payments and purchases.

The ability to filter, review, and export transaction history.

A clean interface that prevents accidental submissions via confirmation dialogs.

Itâ€™s useful for:
Bursars
Account officers

Admin staff in schools or training institutes
...who need to reconcile financial records easily.

### ðŸ”§ How It Works (Key Features)
1. User Login System
Only authorized users can log in with their email and password.

2. Dynamic Task Selection
Users can choose to either make a payment or record a purchase.

3. Smart Forms with Confirmation
Forms update dynamically based on user input.

A confirmation modal appears before any action is processed to prevent mistakes.

If "Cancel" is clicked, the form becomes re-usable again (fixed in latest update).

4. Automatic ID Lookup
When recording payments or purchases, IDs for enrollees, schools, and items are automatically fetched from the database to maintain relational integrity.

5. Filterable and Exportable History Table
Transactions (both payments and purchases) are merged and displayed in one table.

Filters include:
- Date range
- Transaction type (payment or purchase)
- Fee type
- School name
Data is sorted by created date (recent to old).
The history can be exported to CSV.
